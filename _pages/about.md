I'm mostly interested in distributional semantics and word representations but also enjoy working on more syntax-oriented fields like parsing.

I am studying for my master's degree in Computational Linguistics at the University of TÃ¼bingen and am currently employed by the [A3 Project](https://uni-tuebingen.de/forschung/forschungsschwerpunkte/sonderforschungsbereiche/sfb-833/forschungsprojekte/a3-hinrichs/) at the [SFB 833](https://uni-tuebingen.de/forschung/forschungsschwerpunkte/sonderforschungsbereiche/sfb-833/).
