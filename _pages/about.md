I am a doctoral student in Computational Linguistics at the University of TÃ¼bingen and am currently employed by the [A3 Project](https://uni-tuebingen.de/forschung/forschungsschwerpunkte/sonderforschungsbereiche/sfb-833/forschungsprojekte/a3-hinrichs/) at the [SFB 833](https://uni-tuebingen.de/forschung/forschungsschwerpunkte/sonderforschungsbereiche/sfb-833/) and by the [Department of General and Computational Linguistics](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/chairs/general-and-computational-linguistics/).

My research interests include distributional semantics and word representations but I also enjoy working on more syntax-oriented fields like parsing. I am currently working on Attribution in German newspaper text.
