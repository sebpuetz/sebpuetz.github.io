I am a Software Developer at ENLYZE where I am working with Rust in a reverse engineering role. Outside of work, I enjoy coding in Python and Rust.

Before moving to ENLYZE, I briefly was a doctoral student in Computational Linguistics at the University of TÃ¼bingen where I focused on distributional semantics, word representations and more syntax-oriented fields like parsing.
